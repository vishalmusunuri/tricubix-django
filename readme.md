# Intro
This is a relaunch of the old <b><i>"tricubix.com"</i></b> domain. The goal is to create a new website in Django and host it on AWS. 

# Goal
I don't know what I will use this website for at the time of this writing. This will be my experimental website and I 
intend to use this as means to learn some new skills. 

Perhaps the goal will get clearer as I go along.
